/**
 * @question Create a simple class. Inside a second class, define a reference to an object of the first class. Use lazy
 *           initialization to instantiate this object.
 * @explaination Create a class engine, and create a member variable of type int to represent engine number. Also
 *               create a class called Car with a String variable name, which refers to car name. and create object of
 *               Engine class inside car class.
 *
 *               Now create objects of Car and print car name and engine number, separated by ':'. main method should be
 *               created in Composition class
 *              Lazy initialization means to instantiate the variable just before, using it not with declaration.
