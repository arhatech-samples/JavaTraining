/**
 * @question A Fibonacci sequence is the sequence of numbers 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on, where each number
 *           (from the third on) is the sum of the previous two. Create a method that takes an integer as an argument
 *           and displays that many Fibonacci numbers starting from the beginning, e.g., If you run java Fibonacci
 *           5 (where Fibonacci is the name of the class) the output will be: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5.
