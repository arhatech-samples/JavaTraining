/**
 * @question1 Create a class with a default constructor (one that takes no arguments) that prints a message.
 *           Create an object of this class.
 * @explaination1 Create a class Person and create its object in Constructors class's main method.
 *
 * @question2 Add an overloaded constructor that takes a String argument and prints it along with your message.
 * @explaination2 Create an overloaded constructor in Person.
 *
 * @question3 Modify class created for question2 so that 2 more overloaded constructors are created having two arguments each (of two different types),
 *            but in reversed order relative to each other. Verify that this works.
 * @explaination3 Create 2 more overloaded constructors in class Person with String and Int type arguments. The newly created constructors should
 *                have arguments in reverse order relative to each other. ie [(String, int)] in one & [(int, String)] in other.
