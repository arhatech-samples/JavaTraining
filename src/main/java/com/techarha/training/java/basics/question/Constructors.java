 * @question1 Create a class with a default constructor (one that takes no arguments) that prints a message.
 *           Create an object of this class.
 * @question2 Add an overloaded constructor that takes a String argument and prints it along with your message.
 * @question3 Modify question2 so that two of the overloaded constructors have two arguments (of two different types),
 *            but in reversed order relative to each other. Verify that this works.
 *
