/**
 * @question: Write a program that demonstrates that, no matter how many objects you create of a particular class, there is only one instance of a particular static field in that class.
 * @explaination: The class SampleObjectfactory has a createNew() method to create new instances of type SampleObjectFactory.
 * Now there should be a static field in the SampleObjectFactory to keep count of number of instances created for current execution, which we will access through method getObjectCount()
