/**
 *@question1 Write a program with two constant values, one with alternating binary ones and zeroes, with a zero in the
 *          least-significant digit, and the second, also alternating, with a one in the least-significant digit
 *          Take these two values and combine them in all possible ways using the bitwise operators, and display the
 *          results using Integer.toBinaryString( ). (TIJ4 (10))
 *@explaination1 Use hexadecimal constants and use operator for binary AND(&) OR(|) negation(~) and XOR(^)
 *
 * @question2 Start with a number that has a binary one in the most significant position. Using the signed right-shift
 *           operator, right shift it all the way through all of its binary positions, each time displaying the result
 *           using Integer.toBinaryString( ).(TIJ (11))
 * @explaination2 Use hexadecimal constants and use operator for binary AND(&) OR(|) negation(~) and XOR(^)
 *
 * @question3 Write a method that displays char values in binary form. Demonstrate using several different characters.(TIJ (13))
 * @explaination3 NA
